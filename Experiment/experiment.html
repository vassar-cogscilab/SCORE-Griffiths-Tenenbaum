One theory is that the more prior information that is given, the smaller in value predictions will become.

We will look at your individual answers to determine whether they show this theorized decreasing-in-value pattern. If we do in fact narrow our prediction parameters when presented with new information, then your answers to each of the prompts should reflect that.</p>'+
